## Introduction

Algorithm design and analysis is a fundamental aspect of computer science. It involves creating efficient and effective step-by-step procedures to solve various computational problems. This repository serves as a practical resource to understand, implement, and analyze different algorithms used in various applications, ranging from sorting and searching to dynamic programming and graph algorithms.

## Algorithms Covered

This repository covers a wide range of algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Binary Search, Linear Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm, Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Fibonacci sequence, Knapsack problem)
- Greedy algorithms (e.g., Fractional Knapsack, Huffman coding)
- Divide and Conquer algorithms (e.g., Closest Pair of Points, Strassen's Matrix Multiplication)
- And more...

Each algorithm is implemented in a clear and readable manner, accompanied by explanations of the algorithm's logic and time complexity analysis.

## Code Examples

The `code-examples` directory contains a categorized collection of code implementations for the algorithms covered in this repository. Each code example is provided in a commonly used programming language, such as Python, Java, or C++. You can explore these examples to gain a deeper understanding of how each algorithm works in practice.
